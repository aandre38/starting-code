My footprints while I am growing up in this new area.

Hi friends!

I am new to programming, and I have always put aside this type of knowledge in my life with regard to the IT area.
All because someone once told me that programming is easy, but after I tried the logic of programming and... I just couldn't understand it and gave up.

... that was over 15 years ago.
